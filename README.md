InversE: Improving Bilinear Knowledge Graph Embeddings with Canonical Tensor Decomposition
# InversE
This software can be used to reproduce the results in our "InversE: Improving Bilinear Knowledge Graph Embeddings with Canonical Tensor Decomposition" paper. It can be also used to learn `InversE` models for other datasets. The software can be also used as a framework to implement new tensor factorization models
